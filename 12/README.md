## 12. **Error Handling** - Option, Either, Try, Validated, encoding errors as ADTs

### Payment Card Validator

Place the solution under `error_handling` package in your homework repository.

1. Model `PaymentCard` class as an ADT (protect against invalid data as much as it makes sense).

2. Add `ValidationError` cases (at least 5, may be more).

3. Implement `validate` method to construct `PaymentCard` instance from the supplied raw data.
