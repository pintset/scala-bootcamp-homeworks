### Book Server

Create small CRUD for entities from the lecture. You can use any http library (http4s, akka-http etc.).

- Add genre field to Book.

- Create/Read all/Read one required for all entities.

- Update can be added for Book only.


Bonus points:

- Implement a couple of filters for Book and/or Author (year, name/title etc.)

- Return BookWithAuthor instead of Book

- Implement Delete
